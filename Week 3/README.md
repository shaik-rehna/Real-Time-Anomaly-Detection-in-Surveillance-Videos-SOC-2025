# **Welcome to Week 3**
* Last week we have learnt about object detection and custom training of YOLOv5
* This week we will gain practical implementation of training YOLOv5 on a dataset
* We'll be using `Multiple Object Tracking 17(MOT17)` dataset to train the YOLOv5 model 
* First we'll understand about MOT17 dataset and then train YOLOv5 on it
