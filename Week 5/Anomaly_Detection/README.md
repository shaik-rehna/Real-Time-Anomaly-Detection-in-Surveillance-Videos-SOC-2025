* Now we'll use the YOLOv5 detector for detecting the pedestrians in the avenue dataset
* We will use **DeepSORT** for tracking and rule based anomaly logic for detecting anomalies
* Go through the below colab notebook, download it to run
* In week 3, we have trained (YOLOv5s), (YOLOv5m) and (YOLOv5m with few layers freezed)
* Among the three, use the best model as the detector
