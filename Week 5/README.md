# Welcome to Week 5
* In Week 3 we have trained a pedestrian detector using YOLOv5 and MOT17 dataset
* This week we will use that detector and tracking algorithm "DeepSORT" to detect and track pedestrians in Avenue Dataset
* We will also apply anomaly logic on this tracking and find anomalies
* First we'll understand about Avenue dataset and next we'll apply detection, tracking and anomaly detection on it
