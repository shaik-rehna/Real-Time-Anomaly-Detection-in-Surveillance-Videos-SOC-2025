* We'll now learn about YOLO and YOLOv5
* YOLO is a real-time object detection system that processes images in a single pass, balancing speed and accuracy
* YOLOv5, an unofficial successor to YOLOv4, improves upon the architecture with PyTorch implementation, simplified deployment, and better performance on small objects while maintaining real-time speeds.

*(YOLOv5 offers pre-trained models with varying sizes—n, s, m, l, x—for flexibility in speed-accuracy tradeoffs)*
