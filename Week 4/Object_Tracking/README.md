# What is Object Tracking?

* Object tracking refers to the task of:
  * Detecting an object (like a person or car) in a video frame
  * Assigning it a unique ID
  * Following that ID across multiple frames over time

* Why it's important:
  * Surveillance (e.g., tracking intruders or abnormal behavior)
  * Autonomous vehicles (e.g., following pedestrians)
  * Sports analytics, retail footfall, crowd behavior, etc
