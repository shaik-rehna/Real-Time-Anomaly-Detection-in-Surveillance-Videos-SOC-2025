## What is Anomaly Detection?

**Anomaly Detection** = identifying **patterns that deviate significantly** from expected behavior.

In **video**, anomalies could be:

* A person walking **in the wrong direction**.
* A **biker** on a pedestrian path.
* Sudden **running** in a calm area.
* Abandoned objects, fights, etc.



###  Types of Anomaly Detection

| Category            | Description                                     |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | 
| **Supervised**      | Train with labeled normal & abnormal data       |
| **Unsupervised**    | Train **only** on normal data â€“ flag deviations | 
| **Semi-supervised** | Mostly normal data with few anomalies           |
