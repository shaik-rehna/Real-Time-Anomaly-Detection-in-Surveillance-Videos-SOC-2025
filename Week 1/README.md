# **Welcome to Week 1**

* This week, we’ll focus on establishing the core deep learning concepts required for the project
* If you are a beginner in deep learning, start with `Neural Networks` and then move to `Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN)` and `OpenCV`
* If you are familiar with these concepts, you can quickly revise them
* Also, we'll practise few tutorials to deepen our understanding 

Stay engaged and practice consistently to make the most of this learning experience. Keep your enthusiasm high, and let’s begin this exciting journey together!

1. [Neural Networks](./Neural%20networks)

>  This folder contains the resources to gain foundational knowledge on Neural Networks. They have great visual explanations

2. [Convolutional Neural Networks](./CNN)

> This folder contains the resources for Convolutional Neural Networks. There are tutorials at the end to understand how these are implemented in code

3. [OpenCV](./OpenCV)

> This folder contains the resources for OpenCV
