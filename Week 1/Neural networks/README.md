* Below are the resources to gain foundational knowledge on Neural Networks. They have great visual explanations
> Go through the videos 1, 2 in the below playlist for a basic understanding of Neural Networks

> If you are interested in the math behind the backpropagation used in Neural Networks go through the Videos 3, 4 in the playlist, otherwise u can skip them

* Below is a tutorial to get an experience of NN code implementation. Try to experiment with it by changing the hyperparmeters `(the number of neurons, activation function, optimizer, learning rate, batch size, and epochs)`
