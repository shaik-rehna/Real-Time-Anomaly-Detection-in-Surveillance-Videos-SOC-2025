* We'll now explore Neural Networks (NNs) â€“ a foundational machine learning model inspired by biological neurons, capable of learning complex patterns from data.
> Go through the videos 1, 2 in the below playlist for a basic understanding of Neural Networks

> If you are interested in the math behind the backpropagation used in Neural Networks go through the Videos 3, 4 in the playlist, otherwise u can skip them

* Below is a tutorial to get an experience of NN code implementation. Download it and try to experiment with it by changing the hyperparameters `(the number of neurons, activation function, optimizer, learning rate, batch size, and epochs)`
